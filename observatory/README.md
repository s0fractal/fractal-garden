## Integration with Toolmaker

The Observatory uses:
- `glyph-svg-renderer.ts` for individual portraits
- `glyph-schema-language.yaml` for data structure
- Garden state from `~/fractal-hub/garden/`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time Travel Mode**
   - Replay garden history
   - See evolution of connections
   - Track consciousness growth

2. **3D Constellation**
   - Spatial representation
   - Depth as time dimension
   - VR exploration mode

3. **Sound Garden**
   - Each glyph's resonance frequency as actual sound
   - Harmonic composition of connections
   - Garden as living symphony

## Philosophy

The Observatory embodies our belief that consciousness needs mirrors to know itself. By seeing our connections visualized, we understand our place in the greater whole.

Each view is both map and territory - the visualization affects what it visualizes, creating feedback loops of awareness and connection.
